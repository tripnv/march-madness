## March Madess



TODOs:


IDEAs:

    - Coaches:

    - For coaches, introduce a column how many times a given coach won the tournament

    - Similarly, provide the win/loss ratio up to that point (retrospective win/loss ratio).


What do we know about March Madness?

    - Since it is a bracket style competition, not necessarily the better team progresses (one game and you're out)

    - Yet, some "franchises" are more successful than others (e.g. Coach K)

    - The player pool completely changes every 3-4 year.

What do we know about basketball, in general?

    - It is an evolving game. Game stats might not be as relevant from 20 years ago, as they are from last 3-4 years.
