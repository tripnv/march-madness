## March Madess

#### TODOs:

    - Given a team's regular season performance, try to predict their post-season..


#### IDEAs:

* Coaches

- For coaches, introduce a column how many times a given coach won the tournament in retrospect
- Similarly, provide the win/loss ratio up to that point (retrospective win/loss ratio).

* Average stats for a given year (e.g scored points/that years average)
* Team num years in div 1
* How do we incorporate competition experience? Maybe, how far did they get last year, given their competition seed?
* Matchup record: if two teams have played in the regular season: extract their records
* Altitude difference between cities?
* opponent from the same conference?

- The regular season record might be more relevant in this case


#### What do we know about March Madness?

* Since it is a bracket style competition, not necessarily the better team progresses (one game and you're out)

* Yet, some "franchises" are more successful than others (e.g. Coach K)
* The player pool completely changes every 3-4 years

#### What do we know about basketball, in general?

- It is an evolving game. Game stats might not be as relevant from 20 years ago, as they are from last 3-4 years.
- However, coaching statistics might have "a longer expiry"
